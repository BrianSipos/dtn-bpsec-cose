      <t>
The Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec) Specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec"/> defines structure and encoding for Block Integrity Block (BIB) and Block Confidentiality Block (BCB) types but does not specify any security contexts to be used by either of the security block types.
The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) specification <xref target="RFC8152"/> defines a structure, encoding, and algorithms to use for cryptographic signing and encryption.
      </t>
      <t>
This document describes how to use the algorithms and encodings of COSE within BPSec blocks to apply those algorithms to Bundle security in <xref target="sec-bpsec-context"/>.
A bare minimum of interoperability algorithms and algorithm parameters is specified by this document in <xref target="sec-COSE-profile"/>.
The focus of the recommended algorithms is to allow BPSec to be used in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as described in <xref target="sec-pkix-env"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
Examples of specific uses are provided in <xref target="sec-examples"/> to aid in implementation support of the interoperability algorithms.

      <section>
        <name>Scope</name>
        <t>
This document describes a profile of COSE which is tailored for use in BPSec and a method of including full COSE messages within BPSec security blocks.
This document does not address:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
Policies or mechanisms for issuing Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) certificates; provisioning, deploying, or accessing certificates and private keys; deploying or accessing certificate revocation lists (CRLs); or configuring security parameters on an individual entity or across a network.
          </li>
          <li>
Uses of COSE beyond the profile defined in this document.
          </li>
          <li>
How those COSE algorithms are intended to be used within a larger security context.
Many header parameters used by COSE (e.g., key identifiers) depend on the network environment and security policy related to that environment.
          </li>

      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-pkix-env">
        <name>PKIX Environments and CA Policy</name>
        <t>
This specification gives requirements about how to use PKIX certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA), but does not define any mechanisms for how those certificates come to be.
        </t>
        <t>
To support the PKIX uses defined in this document, the CA(s) issuing certificates for BP nodes are aware of the end use of the certificate, have a mechanism for verifying ownership of a Node ID, and are issuing certificates directly for that Node ID.
BPSec security acceptors authenticate the Node ID of security sources when verifying integrity (see <xref target="sec-context-auth"/>) using a public key provided by a PKIX certificate (see <xref target="sec-context-auth"/>) following the certificate profile of <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/>.

This document specifies a single security context for use in both BPSec integrity and confidentiality blocks.
This is done to save code points allocated to this specification and to simplify the encoding of COSE-in-BPSec; the BPSec block type uniquely defines the acceptable parameters and COSE messages which can be present.

The COSE security context SHALL have the Security Context ID specified in <xref target="sec-iana-bpsec-ctx"/>.

Both types of security block can use the same parameters, defined in <xref target="sec-ASB-parameters"/>, to carry public key-related information and each type of security block allows specific COSE message results, defined in <xref target="sec-ASB-results"/>.

        <name>Security Scope</name>
        <t>
The scope here refers to the set of information used by the security context to cryptographically bind with the plaintext data being integrity-protected or confidentiality-protected.
This information is generically referred to as additional authenticated data (AAD), which is also the term used by COSE to describe the same data.
        </t>
        <t>
The sources for AAD within the COSE context are described below, controlled by the AAD Scope Flags parameter of <xref target="sec-ASB-param-AAD-scope"/>, and implemented as defined in <xref target="sec-context-AAD"/>.
        </t>
        <dl>
          <dt>Bundle Primary Block</dt>
          <dd>
The primary block identifies a bundle and, once created, the contents of this block are immutable.
Changes to the primary block associated with the security target indicate that the target is no longer in its original bundle.
Including this data as part of AAD ensures that security target appears in the same bundle that the security source intended.
          </dd>
          <dt>Target Block Metadata</dt>
          <dd>
When the target block is a canonical block (i.e., not the primary block) it contains its block-type-specific data, which is the subject of the security operation, but also metadata identifying the block.
This metadata explicitly excludes the CRC type and value fields because the CRC is derived from the block-type-specific data.   
Including this data as part of AAD ensures that the target data appears in the same block that the security source intended.
          </dd>
          <dt>Security Block Metadata</dt>
          <dd>
The BPSec block containing the security result for which the AAD is assembled also has metadata identifying the block.
Including this data as part of AAD ensures that the security result appears in the same block that the security source intended.

          <t>
The two parameters Additional Protected and Additional Unprotected allow de-duplicating header items which are common to all COSE results.
Both additional header values contain a CBOR map which is to be merged with each of the result's unprotected headers.
Although the additional header items are all treated as unprotected from the perspective of the COSE message, the additional protected map is included within the "external_aad" (see <xref target="sec-context-AAD"/>).
The expected use of additional header map is to contain a certificate (chain) or identifier (see <xref target="sec-asym-keys"/>) which applies to all results in the same security block.
          </t>
          <t>
Following the same pattern as COSE, when both additional header maps are present in a single security block they SHALL not contain any duplicated labels.
Security acceptors SHALL treat a pair of additional header maps containing duplicated labels as invalid.
          </t>
          <t>
No more than one of each Additional Protected and Additional Unprotected parameter SHALL be present in a single security block.
Security acceptors SHALL treat a security block with multiple instances of either additional header type as invalid.
There is no well-defined behavior for a security acceptor to handle multiple Additional Protected parameters.
          </t>
          <t>
Security sources SHOULD NOT include an additional header parameter which represents an empty map.
Security acceptors SHALL handle empty header map parameters, specifically the Additional Protected parameter because it is part of the external_aad.
          </t>
          <t>
Security acceptors SHALL treat the aggregate of both additional header maps as being present in the "unprotected" header map of the COSE message of each result.
If the same header label is present in a additional header map and a result message the item in the result message SHALL take precedence (i.e., the additional header items are added only if they are not already present in a result message).

Additional header maps SHALL NOT contain any private key material.

Only algorithms which support Authenticated Encryption with Authenticated Data (AEAD) SHALL be usable in the first (content) layer of a confidentiality result.
Because COSE encryption with AEAD appends the authentication tag with the ciphertext, the size of the block-type-specific-data will grow after an encryption operation.
Security acceptors MUST NOT assume that the size of the plaintext is the same as the size of the ciphertext.

This section explains how the certificate profile of <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/> is used by a security acceptor to both validate an end-entity certificate and to use that certificate to authenticate the security source for an integrity result.
For a confidentiality result, some of the requirements in this section are implicit in an implementation using a private key associated with a certificate used by a result recipient.
It is an implementation matter to ensure that a BP agent is configured to generate or receive results associated with valid certificates.
          </t>
          <t>
A security source MAY prohibit generating a result (either integrity or confidentiality) for an end-entity certificate which is not considered valid according to <xref target="sec-context-auth-valid-cert"/>.
Generating a result which is likely to be discarded is wasteful of bundle size and transport resources.

Because of the standard policy of using separate certificates for transport, signing, and encryption (see <xref target="sec-pkix-multiple-certs"/>) a single Node ID is likely to be associated with multiple certificates, and any or all of those certificates MAY be present within an "x5bag" in an Additional Protected parameter (see <xref target="sec-ASB-param-additional"/>).
When present, a security acceptor SHALL use an "x5chain" or "x5t" to identify an end-entity certificate to use for result processing.
Security acceptors SHALL NOT assume that a validated certificate containing a NODE-ID matching a security source is enough to associate a certificate with a COSE message or recipient (see <xref target="sec-asym-keys"/>).

For each end-entity certificate contained in or identified by by a COSE result, the security acceptor SHALL perform the certification path validation of <xref section="6" target="RFC5280"/> up to one of the acceptor's trusted CA certificates.
When evaluating a certificate Validity period, the security acceptor SHALL use the bundle Creation Timestamp time (if not unknown) as the reference instead of the current time.
If enabled by local policy, the entity SHALL perform an OCSP check of each certificate providing OCSP authority information in accordance with <xref target="RFC6960"/>.
If certificate validation fails or if security policy disallows a certificate for any reason, the acceptor SHALL treat the associated security result as failed.
Leaving out part of the certification chain can cause the entity to fail to validate a certificate if the left-out certificates are unknown to the entity (see <xref target="sec-threat-untrust-cert"/>).

            <t>
For each end-entity certificate contained in or identified by a COSE context result, the security acceptor SHALL apply security policy to the Key Usage extension (if present) and Extended Key Usage extension (if present) in accordance with <xref section="4.2.1.12" target="RFC5280"/> and the profile in <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/>.

If the NODE-ID validation result is Failure or if the result is Absent and security policy requires an authenticated Node ID, the security acceptor SHALL treat the result as failed.

A RECOMMENDED security policy is to enable the use of OCSP checking when internet connectivity is present.
A RECOMMENDED security policy is that if an Extended Key Usage is present that it needs to contain "id-kp-bundleSecurity" to be usable as an end-entity certificate for COSE security results.
A RECOMMENDED security policy is to require a validated Node ID (of <xref target="sec-context-auth-valid-nodeid"/>) and to ignore any other identifiers in the end-entity certificate.
          </t>
          <t>
This policy relies on and informs the certificate requirements in <xref target="sec-asym-keys-policy-rec"/> and <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/>.
This policy assumes that a DTN-aware CA (see <xref target="sec-pkix-env"/>) will only issue a certificate for a Node ID when it has verified that the private key holder actually controls the DTN node; this is needed to avoid the threat identified in <xref target="sec-threat-node-impersonation"/>.
This policy requires that a certificate contain a NODE-ID and allows the certificate to also contain network-level identifiers.
A tailored policy on a more controlled network could relax the requirement on Node ID validation and/or Extended Key Usage presence.

When used in a BPSec result, each COSE message SHALL contain an explicit algorithm identifier in the lower (content) layers.
When available and not implied by the bundle source, a COSE message SHALL contain a key identifier in the highest (recipient) layer.
See <xref target="sec-asym-keys"/> for specifics about asymmetric key identifiers.
When a key identifier is not available, BPSec acceptors SHALL use the Security Source (if available) and the Bundle Source to imply which keys can be used for security operations.
Using implied keys has an interoperability risk, see <xref target="sec-threat-unident-key"/> for details.
A BPSec security operation always occurs within the context of the immutable primary block with its parameters (specifically the Source Node ID) and the security block with its optional Security Source.

The algorithms required by this profile focuses on networks using shared symmetric-keys, with recommended algorithms for Elliptic Curve (EC) keypairs and RSA keypairs.
The focus of this profile is to enable interoperation between security sources and acceptors on an open network, where more explicit COSE parameters make it easier for BPSec acceptors to avoid assumptions and avoid out-of-band parameters.
The requirements of this profile still allow the use of potentially not-easily-interoperable algorithms and message/recipient configurations for use by private networks, where message size is more important than explicit COSE parameters.

        <name>Asymmetric Key Types and Identifiers</name>
        <t>
This section applies when a BIB uses a public key for verification, or when a BCB uses a public key for encryption.
When using asymmetric keyed algorithms, the security source SHALL include a public key identifier as a recipient header.
The public key identifier SHALL be either a "kid" of <xref target="RFC8152"/>, an "x5t" or "x5chain" of <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-x509"/>, or an equivalent identifier.
        </t>
        <t>
When a BIB result contains a "kid" identifier, the security source MAY include an appropriate COSE public key "COSE_Key" in a key container security parameter (see <xref target="sec-ASB-param-keys"/>).
When BIB result contains a "x5t" identifier, the security source MAY include an appropriate PKIX certificate container ("x5chain" or "x5bag" of <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-x509"/>) in a direct COSE header or an additional header security parameter (see <xref target="sec-ASB-param-additional"/>).
When a BIB result contains an "x5chain", the security source SHOULD NOT also include an "x5t" as the first certificate in the chain is implicitly the applicable end-entity certificate.
For a BIB, if all potential security acceptors are known to possess related public key and/or certificate data then the public key or additional header parameters can be omitted.
Risks of not including related data are described in <xref target="sec-threat-unident-key"/> and <xref target="sec-threat-notrust-key"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
When present, public keys and certificates SHOULD be included as additional header parameters rather than within result COSE messages.
This provides size efficiency when multiple security results are present because they will all be from the same security source and likely share the same public key material.
Security acceptors SHALL still process public keys or certificates present in a result message or recipient as applying to that individual COSE level.
        </t>
        <t>
Security acceptors SHALL aggregate all COSE_Key objects from all parameters within a single BIB or BCB, independent of encoded type or order of parameters.
Because each context contains a single set of security parameters which apply to all results in the same context, security acceptors SHALL treat all public keys as being related to the security source itself and potentially applying to every result.

All end-entity certificates used for BPSec SHALL conform to <xref target="RFC5280"/>, or any updates or successors to that profile.
      </t>
      <t>
This profile requires Version 3 certificates due to the extensions used by this profile.
Security acceptors SHALL reject as invalid Version 1 and Version 2 end-entity certificates.
      </t>
      <t>
Security acceptors SHALL accept certificates that contain an empty Subject field or contain a Subject without a Common Name.
Identity information in end-entity certificates is contained entirely in the subjectAltName extension as a NODE-ID, as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-tcpclv4"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
All end-entity and CA certificates used for BPSec SHOULD contain both a Subject Key Identifier extension in accordance with <xref section="4.2.1.2" target="RFC5280"/> and an Authority Key Identifier extension in accordance with <xref section="4.2.1.1" target="RFC5280"/>.
Security acceptors SHOULD NOT rely on either a Subject Key Identifier and an Authority Key Identifier being present in any received certificate.
Including key identifiers simplifies the work of an entity needing to assemble a certification chain.
      </t>
      <t>
A BPSec end-entity certificate SHALL contain a NODE-ID which authenticates the Node ID of the security source (for integrity) or the security acceptor (for confidentiality).
The identifier type NODE-ID is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-tcpclv4"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
When allowed by CA policy, a BPSec end-entity certificate SHOULD contain a PKIX Extended Key Usage extension in accordance with <xref section="4.2.1.12" target="RFC5280"/>.
When the PKIX Extended Key Usage extension is present, it SHALL contain a key purpose "id-kp-bundleSecurity" as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-tcpclv4"/>.
The "id-kp-bundleSecurity" purpose MAY be combined with other purposes in the same certificate.
      </t>
      <t>
When allowed by CA policy, a BPSec end-entity certificate SHALL contain a PKIX Key Usage extension in accordance with <xref section="4.2.1.3" target="RFC5280"/>.
The PKIX Key Usage bits which are consistent with COSE security are: digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, and keyAgreement.
The specific algorithms used by COSE messages in security results determine which of those key uses are exercised.
See <xref target="sec-pkix-multiple-certs"/> for discussion of key use policies across multiple certificates.
      </t>
      <t>
A BPSec end-entity certificate MAY contain an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) URI within an Authority Information Access extension in accordance with <xref section="4.2.2.1" target="RFC5280"/>.
Security acceptors are not expected to have continuous internet connectivity sufficient to perform OCSP verification.

A RECOMMENDED security policy is to limit asymmetric keys (and thus public key certificates) to single uses among the following:
        </t>
        <dl>
          <dt>Bundle transport:</dt>
          <dd>With key uses as defined in the convergence layer specification(s).</dd>
          <dt>Block signing:</dt>
          <dd>With key use digitalSignature and/or nonRepudiation.</dd>
          <dt>Block encryption:</dt>
          <dd>With key use keyEncipherment and/or keyAgreement.</dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
This policy is the same one recommended by <xref section="6" target="RFC8551"/> for email security and by Section 5.2 of <xref target="NIST-SP800-57"/> more generally.
Effectively this means that a BP node uses separate certificates for transport (e.g., as a TCPCL entity), BIB signing (as a security source), and BCB encryption (as a security acceptor).

        <name>Threat: BPSec Block Replay</name>
        <t>
The bundle's primary block contains fields which uniquely identify a bundle: the Source Node ID, Creation Timestamp, and fragment parameters (see <xref section="4.3.1" target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>).
These same fields are used to correlate Administrative Records with the bundles for which the records were generated.
Including the primary block in the AAD Scope for integrity and confidentiality (see <xref target="sec-ASB-param-AAD-scope"/>) binds the verification of the secured block to its parent bundle and disallows replay of any block with its BIB or BCB.
        </t>
        <t>
This profile of COSE limits the encryption algorithms to only AEAD in order to include the context of the encrypted data as AAD.
If an agent mistakenly allows the use of non-AEAD encryption when decrypting and verifying a BCB, the possibility of block replay attack is present.

        <name>Threat: Untrusted End-Entity Certificate</name>
        <t>
The profile in <xref target="sec-context-auth"/> uses end-entity certificates chained up to a trusted root CA.
A security source can include a certificate set which does not contain the full chain, possibly excluding intermediate or root CAs.
In an environment where security acceptors are known to already contain needed root and intermediate CAs there is no need to include those CAs, but this has a risk of an acceptor not actually having one of the needed CAs.

      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Threat: Certificate Validation Vulnerabilities</name>
        <t>
Even when a security acceptor is operating properly an attacker can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities within certificate check algorithms or configuration to authenticate using an invalid certificate.
An invalid certificate exploit could lead to higher-level security issues and/or denial of service to the Node ID being impersonated.
        </t>
        <t>
There are many reasons, described in <xref target="RFC5280"/> and <xref target="RFC6125"/>, why a certificate can fail to validate, including using the certificate outside of its valid time interval, using purposes for which it was not authorized, or using it after it has been revoked by its CA.
Validating a certificate is a complex task and can require network connectivity outside of the primary BP convergence layer network path(s) if a mechanism such as OCSP <xref target="RFC6960"/> is used by the CA.
The configuration and use of particular certificate validation methods are outside of the scope of this document.

      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-threat-node-impersonation">
        <name>Threat: BP Node Impersonation</name>
        <t>
When certificates are referenced by BIB results it is possible that the certificate does not contain a NODE-ID or does contain one but has a mismatch with the actual security source (see <xref target="sec-pkix-env"/>).
Having a CA-validated certificate does not alone guarantee the identity of the security source from which the certificate is provided; additional validation procedures in <xref target="sec-context-auth"/> bind the Node ID based on the contents of the certificate.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-threat-unident-key">
        <name>Threat: Unidentifiable Key</name>
        <t>
The profile in <xref target="sec-interop-alg"/> recommends key identifiers when possible and the parameters in section <xref target="sec-ASB-parameters"/> allow encoding public keys where available.
If the application using a COSE Integrity or COSE Confidentiality context leaves out key identification data (in a COSE recipient structure), the security acceptor for those BPSec blocks only has the primary block available to use when verifying or decrypting the target block.
This leads to a situation, identified in BPSec Security Considerations, where a signature is verified to be valid but not from the expected Security Source.
        </t>
        <t>
Because the key identifier headers are unprotected (see <xref target="sec-asym-keys"/>), there is still the possibility that an active attacker removes or alters key identifier(s) in the result.
This can cause the security acceptor to not be able to properly verify a valid signature or not use the correct private key to decrypt valid ciphertext.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-threat-notrust-key">
        <name>Threat: Non-Trusted Public Key</name>
        <t>
The profile in <xref target="sec-interop-alg"/> allows the use of PKIX which typically involves end-entity certificates chained up to a trusted root CA.
This allows a BIB to contain end-entity certificates not previously known to a security acceptor but still trust the certificate by verifying it up to a trusted CA.
In an environment where security acceptors are known to already contain needed root and intermediate CAs there is no need to include those CAs in a proper chain within the security parameters, but this has a risk of an acceptor not actually having one of the needed CAs.
        </t>
        <t>
Because the security parameters are not included as AAD, there is still the possibility that an active attacker removes or alters certification chain data in the parameters.
This can cause the security acceptor to be able to verify a valid signature but not trust the public key used to perform the verification.

        <name>Threat: Passive Leak of Key Material</name>

It is important that the key requirements of <xref target="sec-ASB-parameters"/> apply only to public keys and PKIX certificates.

The only differences between these examples which use EC or RSA keypairs and a use of a PKIX public key certificate are: the parameters would have an x5chain parameter instead of a COSE_Key type, and the recipient would contain an "x5t" value instead of a "kid" value.
Neither of these is a change to a protected header so, given the same private key, there would be no change to the signature or wrapped-key data.

Because each of the encryption examples use the same CEK within the same AAD, the target ciphertext is also identical.

The associated public key is included as a security parameter.

This key strength is not supposed to be a secure configuration, only intended to explain the procedure.
This signature uses a random salt, so the full signature output is not deterministic.

        <name>RSA Keypair COSE_Encrypt</name>
        <t>
This is an example of an encryption with a recipient having a 1024-bit RSA keypair identified by a "kid".
The associated public key is included as a security parameter.
        </t>
        <t>
This key strength is not supposed to be a secure configuration, only intended to explain the procedure.
This padding scheme uses a random salt, so the full layer-2 ciphertext output is not deterministic.
