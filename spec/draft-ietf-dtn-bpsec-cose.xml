      <t>
The Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec) Specification <xref target="RFC9172"/> defines structure and encoding for Block Integrity Block (BIB) and Block Confidentiality Block (BCB) types but does not specify any security contexts to be used by either of the security block types.
The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) specifications <xref target="RFC9052"/> and <xref target="RFC9053"/> defines a structure, encoding, and algorithms to use for cryptographic signing and encryption.
      </t>
      <t>
This document describes how to use the algorithms and encodings of COSE within BPSec blocks to apply those algorithms to Bundle security in <xref target="sec-bpsec-context"/>.
A bare minimum of interoperability algorithms and algorithm parameters is specified by this document in <xref target="sec-COSE-profile"/>.
The focus of the recommended algorithms is to allow BPSec to be used in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as described in <xref target="sec-pkix-env"/> using a certificate profile defined in <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
Examples of specific security operations are provided in <xref target="sec-example-ops"/> to aid in implementation support of the interoperability algorithms of <xref target="sec-interop-alg"/>.
Examples of public key certificates are provided in <xref target="sec-example-pkc"/> which are compatible with the profile in <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/> and specific corresponding algorithms.

This document describes a profile of COSE which is tailored for use in BPSec and a method of including full COSE messages within BPSec security blocks.
This document does not address:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
Policies or mechanisms for issuing Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) certificates; provisioning, deploying, or accessing certificates and private keys; deploying or accessing certificate revocation lists (CRLs); or configuring security parameters on an individual entity or across a network.
          </li>
          <li>
Uses of COSE beyond the profile defined in this document.
          </li>
          <li>
How those COSE algorithms are intended to be used within a larger security context.
Many header parameters used by COSE (e.g., key identifiers) depend on the network environment and security policy related to that environment.

      <section anchor="sec-pkix-env">
        <name>PKIX Environments and CA Policy</name>
        <t>
This specification gives requirements about how to use PKIX certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA), but does not define any mechanisms for how those certificates come to be.
        </t>
        <t>
To support the PKIX uses defined in this document, the CA(s) issuing certificates for BP nodes are aware of the end use of the certificate, have a mechanism for verifying ownership of a Node ID, and are issuing certificates directly for that Node ID.
BPSec security verifiers and acceptors authenticate the Node ID of security sources when verifying integrity (see <xref target="sec-context-auth"/>) using a public key provided by a PKIX certificate (see <xref target="sec-context-auth"/>) following the certificate profile of <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/>.

        <name>Use of CDDL</name>
        <t>
This document defines CBOR structure using the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) of <xref target="RFC8610"/>.
The entire CDDL structure can be extracted from the XML version of this document using the XPath expression:
        </t>
        <sourcecode>'//sourcecode[@type="cddl"]'</sourcecode>

The following initial fragment defines the top-level rules of this document's CDDL, including the ASB data structure with its parameter/result sockets and rules needed for validating the example CBOR content.

The definitions for the rules <tt>MAC_structure</tt>, <tt>Sig_structure</tt>, <tt>Enc_structure</tt>, and <tt>COSE_KeySet</tt> are taken from COSE <xref target="RFC9052"/>.

This document specifies a single security context for use in both BPSec integrity and confidentiality blocks.
This is done to save code points allocated to this specification and to simplify the encoding of COSE-in-BPSec; the BPSec block type uniquely defines the acceptable parameters and COSE messages which can be present.

Both types of security block can use the same parameters, defined in <xref target="sec-ASB-parameters"/>, to carry public key-related information and each type of security block allows specific COSE message results, defined in <xref target="sec-ASB-results"/>.

        <name>Security Scope</name>
        <t>
The scope here refers to the set of information used by the security context to cryptographically bind with the plaintext data being integrity-protected or confidentiality-protected.
This information is generically referred to as additional authenticated data (AAD), which is also the term used by COSE to describe the same kind of data.
COSE additionally distinguishes between its own internal AAD, derived from COSE message content, and <em>external AAD</em> provided by the embedding application, which in this case is the BPSec context.
        </t>
        <t>
The sources for external AAD within the COSE context are described below, controlled by the <xref target="sec-ASB-param-AAD-scope">AAD Scope parameter</xref>, and implemented as defined in <xref target="sec-secctx-aad"/>.
The purpose of this parameter is similar to the AAD Scope parameter and Integrity Scope parameter of <xref target="RFC9173"/> but expanded to allow including <em>any</em> block in the bundle as AAD.
        </t>
        <dl newline="true">
          <dt>Primary Block:</dt>
          <dd>
The primary block identifies a bundle and, once created, the contents of this block are immutable.
Changes to the primary block associated with the security target indicate that the target is no longer in its original bundle.
Including the primary block as part of AAD ensures that security target appears in the same bundle that the security source intended.
          </dd>
          <dt>Canonical Block-Type-Specific Data:</dt>
          <dd>
Including the block-type-specific data (BTSD) of a non-target block as part of AAD ensures that that other block's BTSD does not change after the security block is added.
This can guarantee that not only has the security target BTSD not changed but the additional blocks' BTSD have not changed.
          </dd>
          <dt>Canonical Block Metadata:</dt>
          <dd>
Including block metadata, which identifies and types a block, as part of AAD ensures that the block presence does not change after the security block is added.
This metadata explicitly excludes the CRC type and value fields because the CRC is derived from the BTSD.
The metadata of the security block and the target block are also allowed, which binds the security result to that specific target.
          </dd>
          <dt>Containing Abstract Security Block:</dt>
          <dd>
            <t>
The above sources of AAD allow covering the primary block, target block, and any other block besides the security block which contains the security operation for this COSE context
The metadata of the containing security block can be included as described above, using AAD scope key -2 with the flag for metadata, but the BTSD of the security block (as defined in <xref section="3.6" target="RFC9172"/>) is also partially covered by AAD.
            </t>
            <t>
The Security Targets field can be included indirectly by using AAD scope key -1 with the flag for metadata, which includes the target block number.
The Security Context ID is not included directly, but modification of this field will cause processing (verification or acceptance) of the associated security operations to fail.
The Security Source field is included as AAD unconditionally, so is protected from modification.
The Security Context Flags and Security Context Parameters are not included directly, but the modification of parameters will cause processing of security operations to fail.
The Security Results are also not included directly, but these are the COSE messages themselves which are designed to be handled as plaintext.
            </t>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <t>
Because of the above, it is possible for a security source to create a COSE context integrity operation which covers every block of a bundle at the time the BIB is added (excluding CRC Type and value fields).
By using a minimal AAD scope it is also possible for an integrity operation to cover only the BTSD of a single target block independently of the block metadata or bundle primary block associated with the target at the time the BIB is added.

When a parameter is not present and a default value is defined below, a security verifier or acceptor <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> use that default value to process the target:

        </ul>
        <section anchor="sec-ASB-param-additional">
          <name>Additional Header Maps</name>
          <t>
The two parameters Additional Protected and Additional Unprotected allow de-duplicating header items which are common to all COSE results.
Both additional header values contain a CBOR map which is to be merged with each of the result's unprotected headers.
Although the additional header items are all treated as unprotected from the perspective of the COSE message, the additional protected map is included within the <xref target="sec-secctx-aad">external AAD</xref>.
The expected use of additional header map is to contain a certificate (chain) or identifier (see <xref target="sec-asym-keys"/>) which applies to all results in the same security block.
          </t>
          <t>
Following the same pattern as COSE, when both additional header maps are present in a single security block they <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> not contain any duplicated labels.
Security verifiers and acceptors <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> treat a pair of additional header maps containing duplicated labels as invalid.
          </t>
          <t>
No more than one of each Additional Protected and Additional Unprotected parameter <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be present in a single security block.
Security verifiers and acceptors <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> treat a security block with multiple instances of either additional header type as invalid.
There is no well-defined behavior for a security acceptor to handle multiple Additional Protected parameters.
          </t>
          <t>
Security sources <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> include an additional header parameter which represents an empty map.
Security verifiers and acceptors <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> handle empty header map parameters, specifically the Additional Protected parameter because it is part of the <xref target="sec-secctx-aad">external AAD</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
Security verifiers and acceptors <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> treat the aggregate of both additional header maps as being present in the <tt>unprotected</tt> header map of the highest-layers of the COSE message of each result.
For single-layer messages (<em>i.e.</em>, COSE_Encrypt0, COSE_MAC0, and COSE_Sign1) the additional headers apply to the message itself (layer 0) and for other messages the additional headers apply to the final recipients.
If the same header label is present in a additional header map and a COSE layer's headers the item in the result header <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> take precedence (<em>i.e.</em>, the additional header items are added only if they are not already present in a layer's header).
          </t>
          <t>
Additional header maps <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> NOT contain any private key material.
The security parameters are all stored in the bundle as plaintext and are visible to any bundle handlers.

When embedding COSE messages, the message CBOR structure <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be encoded as a byte string used as the result value.

The Result ID values already provide the same information as the COSE tags (using the same code points).

Otherwise, next part <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be the encoded form of the first three fields of the block (<em>i.e.</em>, the block type code, block number, and control flags) identified by the block number in the map key.
This is just the three encoded CBOR unsigned integer fields concatenated with no framing (array or otherwise).

This is a definite-length CBOR byte string.
This part will be identical to the encoded BTSD item from the target block itself if that target block conforms to <xref section="4.3.2" target="RFC9171"/>.

Be aware that, because of deterministic encoding requirements here, there is no guarantee that AAD parts containing the same CBOR data as the ASB or containing bundle (<em>e.g.</em>, the Security Source field), result in the same encoded byte string.
When generated by the same entity they are expected to be the same, but an entity verifying or accepting a security operation <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> treat bundle and block contents as untrusted input and re-encode the AAD parts.

When present, a security verifier or acceptor <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> use an "x5chain" or "x5t" to identify an end-entity certificate to use for result processing.
Security verifiers and acceptors <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> NOT assume that a validated certificate containing a NODE-ID matching a security source is enough to associate a certificate with a COSE message or recipient (see <xref target="sec-asym-keys"/>).

When evaluating a certificate Validity time interval, a security verifier or acceptor <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> use the Bundle Creation Time of the primary block as the reference instead of the current time.

This policy relies on and informs the certificate requirements in <xref target="sec-asym-keys-policy-rec"/> and <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/>.
This policy assumes that a DTN-aware CA (see <xref target="sec-pkix-env"/>) will only issue a certificate for a Node ID when it has verified that the private key holder actually controls the DTN node; this is needed to avoid the threat identified in <xref target="sec-threat-node-impersonation"/>.
This policy requires that a certificate contain a NODE-ID and allows the certificate to also contain network-level identifiers.
A tailored policy on a more controlled network could relax the requirement on Node ID validation and/or Extended Key Usage presence.

Each algorithm in this profile is marked as being US CNSS CNSA 1.0 conformant <xref target="CNSA1"/> or CNSA 2.0 conformant <xref target="CNSA2"/> to aid in further narrowing of network-specific profiles and implementations.
All of these algorithms in this profile are approved by US NIST FIPS 140-3 <xref target="NIST-FIPS-140"/>, however FIPS 140 certification involves review of software and hardware design and implementation detail outside the scope of this document.

The threshold for minimum security strength to be included in this interoperability minimum is roughly equivalent to CNSA 1.0 and the CCSDS Space Data Link Security rationale green book <xref target="CCSDS-SDLS"/>.
The breadth of algorithm variety is intended to cover many different current use cases beyond simple symmetric key security and be compatible with current PKIX mechanisms and strategies.

The choice of whether to use ECDH in static-static (SS) or ephemeral-static (EH) mode depends on what security properties are needed for the operation.
ECDH-SS can reduce message size and allows key generation to happen outside of the source entity, but also requires the ECC public key to either be known by the recipient(s) and identified by or be fully transmitted by a header parameter (as discussed in <xref section="6.3.1" target="RFC9053"/>).
ECDH-ES can provide forward secrecy by using the ephemeral key only for single messages, but also requires the source to generate a new key when needed.

        <name>Symmetric Keys and Identifiers</name>
        <t>
This section applies when a BIB or BCB uses a shared symmetric key for MAC, encryption, or key-wrap.
When using symmetric keyed algorithms, the security source <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> include a symmetric key identifier as a signature or recipient header.
The symmetric key identifier <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be either a "kid" of <xref target="RFC9052"/> (possibly with "kid context" of <xref target="RFC8613"/>), or an equivalent identifier.
This requirement makes the selection of keys by verifiers and acceptors unambiguous.
        </t>
        <t>
When present, a "kid" parameter is used to uniquely identify a single shared key known to the security source and all expected security verifiers and acceptors.
Specific strategies or mechanisms to generate or ensure uniqueness of "kid" values within some domain of use is outside the scope of this profile.
Specific users of this profile can define such mechanisms specific to their abilities and needs.
        </t>
        <t>
When present, a "kid context" parameter <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be used as a correlator with a larger scope than an individual "kid" value.
The use of a "kid context" allows security verifiers and acceptors to correlate using that larger scope even if they cannot match the sibling "kid" value.
For example, a "kid context" can be used to identify a long-lived security association between two entities while an individual "kid" identifies a single shared key agreed within that larger association.

        <name>Asymmetric Key Types and Identifiers</name>
        <t>
This section applies when a BIB uses a public key for verification or key-wrap, or when a BCB uses a public key for encryption or key-wrap.
When using asymmetric keyed algorithms, the security source <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> include a public key container or public key identifier as a signature or recipient header.
The public key identifier <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be either an "x5t" or "x5chain" of <xref target="RFC9360"/>, or "kid" (possibly with "kid context"), or an equivalent identifier.
        </t>
        <t>
When BIB result contains a "x5t" identifier, the security source <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include an appropriate certificate container ("x5chain" or "x5bag") in a direct COSE header or an additional header security parameter (see <xref target="sec-ASB-param-additional"/>).
When a BIB result contains an "x5chain", the security source <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> also include an "x5t" because the first certificate in the chain is implicitly the applicable end-entity certificate.
For a BIB, if all potential security verifiers and acceptors are known to possess related public key and/or certificate data then the public key or additional header parameters can be omitted.
Risks of not including related credential data are described in <xref target="sec-threat-unident-key"/> and <xref target="sec-threat-notrust-key"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
When present, public keys and certificates <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be included as additional header parameters rather than within result COSE messages.
This provides size efficiency when multiple security results are present because they will all be from the same security source and likely share the same public key material.
Security verifiers and acceptors <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> still process public keys or certificates present in a result message or recipient as applying to that individual COSE level.
        </t>
        <t>
Security verifiers and acceptors <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> aggregate all COSE_Key objects from all parameters within a single BIB or BCB, independent of encoded type or order of parameters.
Because each context contains a single set of security parameters which apply to all results in the same context, security verifiers and acceptors <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> treat all public keys as being related to the security source itself and potentially applying to every result.

The bundle's primary block contains fields which uniquely identify a bundle: the Source Node ID, Creation Timestamp, and fragment parameters (see <xref section="4.3.1" target="RFC9171"/>).
These same fields are used to correlate Administrative Records with the bundles for which the records were generated.
Including the primary block in the AAD Scope for integrity and confidentiality (see <xref target="sec-ASB-param-AAD-scope"/>) binds the verification of the secured block to its parent bundle and disallows replay of any block with its BIB or BCB.

The profile in <xref target="sec-context-auth"/> uses end-entity certificates chained up to a trusted root CA, where each certificate has a specific validity time interval.
        </t>
        <t>
A security verifier or acceptor needs to assemble an entire certificate chain in order to validate the use of an end-entity certificate.
A security source can include a certificate set which does not contain the full chain, possibly excluding intermediate or root CAs.
In an environment where security verifiers and acceptors are known to already contain needed root and intermediate CAs there is no need to include those CAs, but this has a risk of a relying node not actually having one of the needed CAs.
        </t>
        <t>
A security verifier or acceptor needs to use the bundle creation time when assembling a certificate chain and and validating it.
Because of this, a security source needs to use the bundle creation time as the specific instant for choosing appropriate certificate(s) based on their validity time interval.
The selection of a certificate outside of its validity time period will cause the entire security operation to be unusable.

      <section>
        <name>Threat: Certificate Validation Vulnerabilities</name>
        <t>
Even when a security acceptor is operating properly an attacker can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities within certificate check algorithms or configuration to authenticate using an invalid certificate.
An invalid certificate exploit could lead to higher-level security issues and/or denial of service to the Node ID being impersonated.
        </t>
        <t>
There are many reasons, described in <xref target="RFC5280"/> and <xref target="RFC6125"/>, why a certificate can fail to validate, including using the certificate outside of its validity time interval, using purposes for which it was not authorized, or using it after it has been revoked by its CA.
Validating a certificate is a complex task and can require network connectivity outside of the primary BP convergence layer network path(s) if a mechanism such as OCSP <xref target="RFC6960"/> is used by the CA.
The configuration and use of particular certificate validation methods are outside of the scope of this document.

When certificates are referenced by BIB results it is possible that the certificate does not contain a NODE-ID or does contain one but has a mismatch with the actual security source (see <xref target="sec-pkix-env"/>).
Having a CA-validated certificate does not alone guarantee the identity of the security source from which the certificate is provided; additional validation procedures in <xref target="sec-context-auth"/> bind the Node ID based on the contents of the certificate.

The profile in <xref target="sec-interop-alg"/> recommends key identifiers when possible and the parameters in section <xref target="sec-ASB-parameters"/> allow encoding public keys where available.
If the application using a COSE Integrity or COSE Confidentiality context leaves out key identification data (in a COSE recipient structure), a security verifier or acceptor for those BPSec blocks only has the primary block available to use when verifying or decrypting the target block.
This leads to a situation, identified in BPSec Security Considerations, where a signature is verified to be valid but not from the expected Security Source.
        </t>
        <t>
Because the key identifier headers are unprotected (see <xref target="sec-asym-keys"/>), there is still the possibility that an active attacker removes or alters key identifier(s) in the result.
This can cause a security verifier or acceptor to not be able to properly verify a valid signature or not use the correct private key to decrypt valid ciphertext.

The profile in <xref target="sec-interop-alg"/> allows the use of PKIX which typically involves end-entity certificates chained up to a trusted root CA.
A BIB can reference or contain end-entity certificates not previously known to a security acceptor but the acceptor can still trust the certificate by verifying it up to a trusted CA.
In an environment where security verifiers and acceptors are known to already contain needed root and intermediate CAs there is no need to include those CAs in a proper chain within the security parameters, but this has a risk of an acceptor not actually having one of the needed CAs.

Because the security parameters are not included as AAD, there is still the possibility that an active attacker removes or alters certification chain data in the parameters.

        <name>AAD-Covered Block Modification</name>
        <t>
The <xref target="sec-ASB-param-AAD-scope">AAD Scope parameter</xref> can be used to refer to any other block within the same bundle (by its unique block number) at the time the associated security operation is added to a bundle.
Because of this, if any block within the AAD coverage is modified (by any node along the bundle's forwarding path) in a way which affects the generated <xref target="sec-secctx-aad">AAD value</xref> it will cause verification or acceptance of the containing security operation to fail.
        </t>
        <t>
One reason why such a modification would be made is that the other block has an expected lifetime shorter than the security operation.
For example, a Previous Node block (<xref section="4.4.1" target="RFC9171"/>) is expected to be removed or replaced at each hop.
The AAD Scope parameter <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> reference any other block with an expected lifetime shorter than the containing security operation.
        </t>
        <t>
Another reason for a modification is that the other block is designed to be updated along the forwarding path.
For example, a Hop Count block (<xref section="4.4.3" target="RFC9171"/>) is expected to be modified as the bundle is forwarded by each node.
The AAD Scope parameter <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> reference any other block using the flag <tt>AAD-btsd</tt> (<xref target="tab-AAD-scope-flags"/>) if that other block is expected to be modified by intermediate nodes during the lifetime of the containing security operation.
        </t>
        <t>
One reason for a block to be removed is if it has its block processing control flags (<xref section="4.2.4" target="RFC9171"/>) have the bit set indicating "Discard block if it can't be processed" and the block type or type-specific data cannot be handled by any node along the forwarding path.
The AAD Scope parameter <bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14> reference any other block having block processing control flags with the bit set indicating "Discard block if it can't be processed" unless it is known that all possible receiving nodes can process the associated block type during the lifetime of the containing security operation.

Within the "Bundle Protocol" registry group <xref target="IANA-BUNDLE"/>, the IANA has created and now maintains a new registry named "BPSec COSE AAD Scope Flags".
<xref target="tab-iana-aad-scope-flags"/> shows the initial values for this registry.

The registration policy for this registry is Specification Required.
Specifications of new entries need to define how they relate to AAD generation procedure of <xref target="sec-secctx-aad"/>.

These examples are intended to have the correct structure of COSE security blocks but in some cases use simplified algorithm parameters or smaller key sizes than are required by the actual COSE profile defined in this documents.
Each example indicates how it differs from the actual profile if there is a meaningful difference.

All of these examples operate within the context of the bundle primary block of <xref target="fig-ex-primary-block"/> with a security target block of <xref target="fig-ex-target-block"/>.

The only differences between these examples which use ECC or RSA keypairs and a use of a public key certificate are: the highest-layer parameters would contain an "x5t" (or equivalent, see <xref target="sec-asym-keys"/>) value instead of a "kid" value.
This would not be a change to a protected header so, given the same private key, there would be no change to the signature or wrapped-key data.

Because each of the COSE_Encrypt examples using key wrap or encapsulation (<xref target="sec-example-ops-kek-recip-wrap"/>, <xref target="sec-example-ops-ec-recip-wrap"/>, <xref target="sec-example-ops-rsa-recip"/>) use the same CEK within the same AAD, the target ciphertext is also identical.
The target block after application of the encryption is shown in <xref target="fig-ex-encrypt-target-final"/>.

This is an example of a signature with the signer having a 3072-bit RSA keypair identified by a "kid".
        </t>
        <t>
This key strength is not supposed to be a secure configuration, only intended to explain the procedure.
This signature uses a random salt, so the full signature output is not deterministic.

      <t>
This section contains example public key certificates corresponding to end-entity private keys and identities used in examples of <xref target="sec-example-ops"/> with structure and extensions conforming to the profile of <xref target="sec-pkix-profile"/>.
All of the example certificates contain a validity time interval extending a short amount around the original bundle creation time of the <xref target="fig-ex-primary-block">original bundle</xref>.

        <name>Root CA Certificate</name>
        <t>
This root CA certificate and private key are included for completeness in testing <xref target="sec-context-auth-valid-cert">path validation</xref> with a full chain.
This root CA does not allow any intermediates purely as an example, while a typical deployed PKI would separate a root CA from intermediate signing CA(s).
It also does not include any Certificate Policies, Name Constraints, or Policy Constraints extensions as an operational CA might do to express or control how its subordinates are validated and used.
It does, however, include an Extended Key Usage (EKU) value <tt>id-kp-bundleSecurity</tt> which indicates that this certificate tree is authorized for securing BP data.

      <name>CDDL Definitions for BPSec</name>
      <t>
The normative definitions of BPSec <xref target="RFC9172"/> do not include corresponding CDDL extending the rules defined for BP.
The following CDDL provides those definitions as an update to that specification.
These definitions include a new socket <tt>$ext-data-asb</tt> for all possible ASB contents and a generic rule <tt>bpsec-context-use</tt> which allows a security context to define a single rule for the ASB socket to include all of their parameter and result types together.

[NOTE to the RFC Editor: please remove this section before publication, as well as the reference to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, <xref target="github-dtn-bpsec-cose"/>, <xref target="github-dtn-demo-agent"/>, and <xref target="gitlab-wireshark"/>.]

This section records the status of known implementations of the
protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
<xref target="RFC7942"/>.
The description of implementations in this section is
intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual
implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not
intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
implementations or their features. Readers are advised to note that
other implementations can exist.
      </t>
      <t>
A limited implementation of this COSE Context has been added to the <xref target="github-dtn-demo-agent"/> to help with interoperability testing.
      </t>
      <t>
As of the time of writing a COSE Context dissector has been accepted to the default development branch of the Wireshark project <xref target="gitlab-wireshark"/>.
That dissector integrates the full-featured COSE dissector on top of BPSec, so will scale with any future additions to COSE itself.
      </t>
      <t>
An example implementation of this COSE Context has been created as a GitHub project <xref target="github-dtn-bpsec-cose"/> and is intended to use as a proof-of-concept and as a source of data for the examples in <xref target="sec-example-ops"/>.
This example implementation only handles CBOR encoding/decoding and cryptographic functions, it does not construct actual BIB or BCB and does not integrate with a BP Agent.
